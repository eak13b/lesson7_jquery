### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson I learned about jQuery, a commonly used library that allows 
    users to implement JavaScript code with a minimal amount of code which then 
    allows for a smaller file size.
2. I also learned that every line used for jQuery needs to begin with the $ 
    sign because it tells the program that the following code should be interpreted 
    with a jQuery library. 
3. I learned about the event.currentTarget event handler method which was used to 
    show which element needed to be currently targeted.
